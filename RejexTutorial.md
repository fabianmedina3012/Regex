# Rejex Tutorial 
Hello, this is a tutorial about what a Rerjex is and its different components. Thank you for reading! 

## Summary

A regular expression, or regex for short, is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. Regexes are used to search for and match specific patterns in strings of text, and they are often used in programming and text processing. Here is an example of a regex code:

Example regex: \b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,}\b

This regex can be used to match email addresses in a string of text. The regex looks for patterns that match the structure of an email address: it starts with one or more characters (letters, numbers, or certain symbols) followed by an @ symbol, followed by one or more characters (letters, numbers, or certain symbols) followed by a period, followed by two or more letters. The \b characters at the beginning and end of the regex indicate word boundaries, which helps to ensure that the regex only matches complete email addresses and not parts of other words.

Regexes can be used in various programming languages and tools to search for and manipulate text. For example, a programmer might use a regex to extract email addresses from a list of names and addresses, or to validate that a user's input in a form field is a properly formatted email address.
